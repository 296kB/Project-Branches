# Project Branches ðŸŒ³
A simple mobile and web app that allows users to create lists for their projects. Users can ass tasks, delete them and also mark them as complete.

## Link to project: 
https://project-branches-production.up.railway.app/

## How It's Made:

## Tech / Libraries used: 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript 
- Node.js 
- MongoDB 
- Mongoose 
- EJS

This was a 5 days long group project built during our time at the #100devs agency. Project goals included
using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing ourselves with the group work dynamics.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
